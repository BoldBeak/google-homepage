## Personal Progress Notes:

I took some time away from this project and have recently come back to it.
So far I have set up the basic elements (logo, search box, and buttons)
I chose to use flexbox for the layout and this was a good review of what I had learned.

I still don't feel I have a good handle on units of measure in CSS but am happy with the overall result thus far.

Finished! I was farther along than I thought. 

My biggest challenge with this was a bug that messed up my CSS. I double and triple checked that I was using the correct CSS properties for my flex layout but they weren't being applied. I finally realized I had managed to paste a hex code outside of the brackets a couple of lines up. Fixed the problem and found that I had been applying the style correctly.
